I currently work at [Reality Labs Research](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/) doing UX research for audio and integrated experiences. [This article](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio/) gives a good overview of the kinds of problems I work on. Both at and outside of my work, I'm interested in voice/audio tech, the perception-production interface, quantitative/mixed methods, multilingualism, social variation, and how context of all kinds shapes communication. 

I almost have a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of British Columbia (defending in Dec. 2021!). My dissertation research focused on phonetic variation in bilingual speech production and creating the [spontaneous speech corpus](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/) needed for that work. As a part of the [Speech-in-Context Lab](https://speechincontext.arts.ubc.ca/), I developed and analyzed various speech perception experiments in areas like perceptual learning/adaptation, talker identification, and talker evaluation. Most of my publications are available for free on the [cv](/cv/) page.

I have a strong foundation in corpus-based and experimental quantitative research methods. I use both R and Python and like to think deeply about causal relationships and apply scientific inference to real, hard problems. I occasionally [blog](/post/) about these topics. 

If you are a linguistics or psychology or social sciences grad student thinking about making the jump to the tech industry, I'm always happy to share my experiences and knowledge. I care deeply about access to information, working on diverse teams, and love mentoring&mdash;as both mentor and mentee.
