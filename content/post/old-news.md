These are short blurbs from the news section of my old website. Not a lot of detail, but there are plenty of links! Some of these items might get a more in depth treatment as I build out this blog. <!--more-->

- **December 16, 2020**: I presented my work on bilingual acoustic voice variation from both Interspeech 2020 and ASA 179 for the UBC Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing Lab. [Check out my slides here](https://github.com/UBC-NLP/dl-nlp-rg/blob/master/slides/20201216_voice-variability-for-ubc-dl-nlp-lab.pdf).
- **December 9, 2020**: New preprint on OSF with Molly Babel and Christina Sen on [Asymmetries in Perceptual Adjustments to Non-Canonical Pronunciations](https://osf.io/vdpbr/). 
- **November 16, 2020**: I just joined the [SPARK Society](https://www.sparksociety.org/), and you should too because their mission is to empower cognitive scientists of color. 
- **November 11, 2020**: I recently published a tutorial for implementing online experiments using [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) and S3 buckets on AWS. [Check it out on the Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/3ufx7/)! ðŸŒ¼
- **November 9, 2020**: I'm presenting on The effect of passage length on acoustic voice variability in bilingual speech (12/9) and supporting my co-author Angelina Lloy with Bilingual talker identification with spontaneous speech in Cantonese and English: the role of language-specific knowledge (12/10) at [ASA 179](https://acousticalsociety.org/asa-meetings/). 
- **October 29, 2020**: Interspeech 2020 was a lot of waking up early ðŸŒ… (Pacific Time!) and [live-tweeting](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23interspeech2020%20%40khia_johnson&src=typed_query). The [proceedings paper](https://isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2020/pdfs/3095.pdf) and [YouTube-version-of-my-talk](https://youtu.be/vhRuEWEIRao) are available.
- **May 15, 2020**: Our paper [SpiCE: A New open-access corpus of conversational bilingual speech in Cantonese and English](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.503.pdf) was published in the [LREC 2020](https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/) proceedings. The public release of the corpus is scheduled for (late) January 2021.
- **March 27, 2020**: I'll be presenting a poster on [Uniformity and crosslinguistic influence in Cantonese-English bilingual stops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ni9ohb0GPHMcBG9kEE6Kl10y3sO62GJm/view) at [ISBPAC3](https://www.isbpac.org/), whenever it gets rescheduled. ðŸ—“
- **March 23, 2020**: New paper! [Lexically-guided perceptual learning in Cantonese-English bilinguals](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/10.0000942) was published in JASA Express Letters.

News older than this never made it on the website, so you'll have to guess? Ask me? Extrapolate from my [cv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-ufr5DFoXTPny2jZjyCUaYXTF_BuNyB/view), or something.. ðŸ™ƒ
