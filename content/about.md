I'm a UX Research Scientist at [Reality Labs Research Audio](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio/), where I work on questions related to how humans experience, perceive, and interact with novel audio and communication technologies. I'm interested in speech, voice, audio, hearing science, language tech, the perception-production interface, quantitative/mixed methods, R, multilingualism, social variation, how context of all kinds shapes communication, and applying scientific inference to real, hard problems. I first recruited an Audio UX Research Scientist Intern in 2023, and hope to do so annually!

I have a PhD from [UBC Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/), where my research focused on phonetic variation in bilingual speech production and creating the [spontaneous speech corpus](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/) needed for that work. As a part of the [Speech-in-Context Lab](https://speechincontext.arts.ubc.ca/), I focused on speech perception in areas like perceptual learning/adaptation, talker identification, and talker evaluation. Most of my [publications](/content/publications.md) are freely available.

If you are a linguistics, psychology, or social sciences graduate student or postdoctoral researcher thinking about making the jump to the tech industry, you can read my [blog post](/post/2022/getting-a-start-in-tech/) or get in touch with me. The best ways to do that are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khiajohnson/) or by email at [hello@khiajohnson.com](mailto:hello@khiajohnson.com), as I no longer use of Twitter and Mastodon. I get a lot of connection requests on LinkedIn, so a short note about why you're reaching out and how you found me is always nice!
