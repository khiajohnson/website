This is a short blog post. If you're here, maybe you already know this. But mostly, I'm thrilled to say that I'm officially a doctor of linguistics, program-completed, library-approved, out-of-the-academy doctor of linguistics. <!--more-->

My dissertation lives both in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/khiajohnson/dissertation) (there's code there too!) and in UBC's ciRcle repository at its fancy *permanent* URL: <http://hdl.handle.net/2429/80517>. There's also my [defense slides](/pdfs/johnson-defense-slides.pdf)) for quickly skimming the take-home points. 

And perhaps most importantly, [**the data**](https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/MJOXP3). Please use it and tell me about the cool things you learn from it! I promise to remember how to update the Read-the-Docs and [feature your work](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/research.html) there!

I used a lot of exclamation marks here, and it's because I'm a giant ball of excitement and relief about being done.
