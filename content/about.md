I'm a User Experience Researcher at [Reality Labs Research](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/), where I work on questions related to how humans experience, perceive, and interact with novel audio technologies. This article on ["The Future of Audio"](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio/) gives a good overview. Both at and outside of my work, I'm interested in speech/voice/audio/language tech, the perception-production interface, quantitative/mixed methods, multilingualism, social variation, and how context of all kinds shapes communication. 

I successfully defended my PhD [dissertation](https://github.com/khiajohnson/dissertation) in linguistics from the University of British Columbia on December 10, 2021. My dissertation research focused on phonetic variation in bilingual speech production and creating the [spontaneous speech corpus](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/) needed for that work. As a part of the [Speech-in-Context Lab](https://speechincontext.arts.ubc.ca/), I developed and analyzed various speech perception experiments in areas like perceptual learning/adaptation, talker identification, and talker evaluation. Most of my publications are freely available.

I have a strong foundation in corpus-based and experimental quantitative research methods. I use both R and Python and like to think deeply about causal relationships, applying scientific inference to real, hard problems. I occasionally [blog](/post/) about these topics. 

If you are a linguistics, psychology, or social sciences grad student thinking about making the jump to the tech industry, I'm always happy to share my experiences and knowledge. I care deeply about access to information, working on diverse teams, and love mentoring&mdash;as both mentor and mentee. You can connect with me by any of the methods listed below. Be sure to tell me a bit about yourself and what you study, and ask for my Calendly.
