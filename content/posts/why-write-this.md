A blog about ***language data analysis*** and ***communicating science***. Why write it? I think it's important to make research on language accessible, and want to improve my skills in this area... so, practice? I'll be thrilled if you like my writing and learn something too. <!--more-->I also think there is an immense lack of intermediate-level tutorials on most of the topics I google  relentlessly, and think that's a gap I can help fill.

#### about me

I study phonetic and phonological variation in bilingual speech—broadly construed—and think about psycholinguistic questions related to processing, representation, and language contact. I use corpus-based and experimental methods to approach these questions in both perception and production. My dissertation focuses on within-talker (dis)similarities in speech sounds and voice quality across languages, and uses a new Cantonese-English bilingual speech corpus I'm developing. I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia, and work  with Dr. Molly Babel in the Speech-in-Context Lab. I'm also a part of the UBC Public Scholars Network, and care a lot about making research in the language sciences accessible to non-academic stakeholders.


#### what I (want to) write about

I have a couple different writing ideas, and they will be tagged as such. This part of the post is subject to future edits as the topic evolves. In any case, all errors are mine.

1. SciComm for my research, or, writing up alternative versions of my published for for a non-specialist audience.
2. More in-depth walkthroughs of the analyses in my publications and presentations. I aim to share scripts etc. in my OSF repository regardless of whether there's a blog post here.
3. Language Data, or, tutorial/analysis style posts where I explore a question with an open-access or web-scraped data set. That might mean data visualization or analysis or both! TBD. 


#### things I use

- I mostly use RStudio along with the `tidyverse` and `brms` packages for statistics and data visualization
- I like Python for most other things, like working with audio, interfacing with Praat via the fantastic `praat-parselmouth` package, and using any number of NLP tools. Right now I really 🧡 `pycantonese`. 
- Various brilliant people doing corpus phonetics and related things maintain a variety of command line tools that you might see pop up here an there.
