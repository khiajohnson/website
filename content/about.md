I'm a UX Research Scientist at [Reality Labs Research Audio](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio/), where I work on questions related to how humans experience, perceive, and interact with novel audio and communication technologies. I'm interested in speech, voice, audio, hearing science, language tech, the perception-production interface, quantitative/mixed methods, R, multilingualism, social variation, how context of all kinds shapes communication, and applying scientific inference to real, hard problems. I first recruited an Audio UX Research Scientist Intern in 2023, and hope to do so again in the future.

I have a PhD from [UBC Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/), where my research focused on phonetic variation in bilingual speech production and creating the [spontaneous speech corpus](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/) needed for that work. As a part of the [Speech-in-Context Lab](https://speechincontext.arts.ubc.ca/), I focused on speech perception in areas like perceptual learning/adaptation, talker identification, and talker evaluation. Most of my [publications](/content/publications.md) are freely available.
