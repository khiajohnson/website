I'm a UX Research Scientist at [Reality Labs Research Audio](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio/), where I work on questions related to how humans experience, perceive, and interact with novel audio and communication technologies and features on products like smart glasses, AR and VR devices. I'm interested in speech, voice, audio, hearing science, language tech, quantitative/mixed methods, R, how context of all kinds shapes communication, and applying scientific inference to real, hard problems. I have hosted an Audio UX Research Scientist Intern in the past and may do so again. Interns are typically recruited in the fall for the following summer or fall. Here is a link to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2024.100451) that resulted from the intern I hosted in 2023.

I have a PhD from [UBC Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/), where my research focused on phonetic variation in bilingual speech production and creating the [spontaneous speech corpus](https://spice-corpus.readthedocs.io/) needed for that work. As a part of the [Speech-in-Context Lab](https://speechincontext.arts.ubc.ca/), I focused on speech perception in areas like perceptual learning/adaptation, talker identification, and talker evaluation. Most of my [publications](/publications.md) are freely available. I briefly maintained a [blog](/post/) during and immediately after grad school.

The best way to get in touch with me is via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khiajohnson/).
